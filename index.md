# Geralt of Rivia

Geralt is a witcher, a monster-slayer - or a 'foul mutant', depending who you ask. He is highly trained in fighting with a sword, but can also make use of the witcher signs.

## Traits

* knows his monsters
* stays calm even in heated situations
* likes horse-racing to win new saddles

> Why men throw away their lives away attacking an armed witcher...
> I'll never know. Something wrong with my face?
